# Digital FTE: The Philosophy of Autonomous Work

## 1. The Core Concept
A **Digital FTE (Full-Time Equivalent)** is a fundamental shift in how we view automation. It is not a tool you use; it is a worker you hire.

*   **Old Way (Passive):** A chatbot waits for you to ask a question.
*   **New Way (Proactive):** A Digital FTE sits at its desk 24/7, watching for work to do, and acts without you needing to initiate.

## 2. The "Agent-Driven" Difference
Why not just use Zapier?
*   **The Problem with Rules:** Traditional automation is "Deterministic." If you tell it "Save emails with 'Invoice' in the subject," it fails when a client writes "Here is my bill." It is brittle.
*   **The Agent Solution:** We use a **Reasoning Engine** (Claude). We don't give it rules; we give it *intent*. "Read this email. Is it asking for money? If so, save it." This allows the software to handle the messiness of the real world just like a human would.

## 3. Local-First: The "Shared Desk"
We reject the cloud dashboard in favor of local files.
*   **Privacy:** Your bank details and private chats stay on your hard drive.
*   **The "Shared Desk" Analogy:** We use **Obsidian** (or simple folders) as a meeting place.
    *   The Agent puts a file in the `Inbox` folder ("Hey, I found this").
    *   You move it to `Approved` ("Go ahead and pay it").
    *   This simple file movement is the interface. It allows human and machine to collaborate asynchronously.

## 4. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
An autonomous agent is powerful, but dangerous. It needs a safety valve.
*   **The Rule:** The Agent can *draft* anything, but *send* nothing (that involves risk).
*   **The Trigger:** The Agent creates a "Pending Approval" file. It pauses. It effectively says, "Boss, I want to pay this $500 invoice. Sign here."
*   **The Action:** Your "Signature" is simply moving that file to the `Approved` folder. This physical action grants the permission.
