# Gold Tier 01: Financial Auditor (Accounting Integration)

> *"The Fiscal Brain: Automating accounting, reconciliation, and expense auditing with zero human input."*

## 1. The Requirement
The Gold Tier Agent must move beyond "seeing" emails and start "understanding" the business's financial health. It must integrate with accounting platforms (Xero, QuickBooks) or bank CSVs to track every dollar.

## 2. Technical Lexicon

| Term | Technical Definition | Context in Digital FTE |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Reconciliation** | The process of ensuring two sets of records (e.g., bank statement vs. invoices) match. | The Agent checking if the money that landed in the bank matches the invoice it sent. |
| **Categorization Engine** | A classifier that assigns transactions to tax categories. | The Agent deciding if a $10 expense is "Office Supplies" or "Software Subscription." |
| **ETL Pipeline** | Extract, Transform, Load. | The process of pulling raw bank data, cleaning it, and loading it into the Vault. |
| **P&L (Profit & Loss)** | A financial statement that summarizes revenues and expenses. | The final report generated by the Agent for the CEO. |

## 3. The Implementation Architecture

### Step 1: Secure Data Ingestion
1.  **Watcher:** A dedicated `FinanceWatcher` polls the bank API or a secure `/Accounting` folder.
2.  **Safety:** Financial data is immediately encrypted or moved to a restricted sub-folder in the Vault.

### Step 2: Autonomous Categorization
1.  **Read:** Claude reads the raw transaction list.
2.  **Refer:** Claude checks `Vault/System/Accounting_Rules.md`.
3.  **Think:** "I see a payment to 'AWS'. This is a Software Expense."
4.  **Action:** The Agent updates the `Accounting/Current_Month.md` file with the categorized transaction.

## 4. Normalization Schema (Financial Snapshot)
The Agent creates a living record of the month's finances.

```markdown
---
type: financial_summary
period: "October 2026"
generated: "2026-10-12T09:00:00Z"

# Revenue Summary
- Total Earned: $12,500
- Pending Invoices: $2,000 (3 invoices)

# Expense Audit
| Category | Amount | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Software | $250 | Includes Netflix (Flagged for Review) |
| Marketing | $500 | Meta Ads |

# CEO Flag
I noticed a duplicate subscription for 'Spotify'. I suggest we cancel one to save $15/mo.

## 5. Why this is Enterprise-Grade
1.  **Anomaly Detection:** The Agent doesn't just record data; it looks for **Patterns**. If an expense is 20% higher than last month, it flags it as a "Bottleneck" in the CEO Briefing.
2.  **Double-Entry Validation:** The Agent cross-references the `/20_Done` folder (tasks it completed) against the Bank Statement to ensure no "Shadow Tasks" were performed.
3.  **Strict Privacy:** Financial data is excluded from the general reasoning context. The Agent only "thinks" about finances in a separate, high-security subprocess.
4.  **Audit Readiness:** Every categorization is logged with a "Confidence Score." If the Agent is <90% sure, it moves the transaction to `/30_Pending_Approval` for human help.
