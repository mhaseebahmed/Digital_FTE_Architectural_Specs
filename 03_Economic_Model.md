# The Economic Model: The "Headcount" Mindset

## 1. The "Aha!" Moment
Why build this? The value proposition comes from a fundamental shift in how we categorize costs.

### Software vs. Headcount
*   **Scenario A (Software):** You ask your boss for a $50/month email tool.
    *   *Reaction:* "Too expensive. Use the free one."
    *   *Why:* Software is a commodity. We want it cheap.
*   **Scenario B (Headcount):** You ask your boss to hire an assistant for $3,000/month.
    *   *Reaction:* "Sure, we have a budget for that."
    *   *Why:* Labor is an investment. We expect to pay for it.

**The Trick:** The Digital FTE costs ~$500/month (in API fees).
*   If you call it "Software," it sounds expensive.
*   If you call it "Headcount" (a replacement employee), it sounds **insanely cheap**. You are getting a full-time worker for 10% of the cost.

## 2. The 90% Savings Rule
*   **The Concept:** Companies hesitate to approve projects that save 10% or 20%. It's not worth the risk.
*   **The Reality:** A Digital FTE typically costs 90% less than a human human doing the same work ($500 vs $5,000).
*   **The Result:** "No Debate." When the savings are an order of magnitude, approval becomes automatic. It justifies automating tiny tasks (like sorting receipts) that a human would never have time for.

## 3. The "Zero Latency" Advantage
It's not just about money; it's about time.
*   **Human:** Waits until Monday morning.
*   **Digital:** Replies at 3:00 AM on Saturday.
*   This creates a business that is "Always On," providing a service level that human teams physically cannot match without massive staffing costs.
